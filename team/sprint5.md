# Sprint 5 - *29* - *Spicy Panda Boiz*

## Goal

## Reliable first release with clean code!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>5.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* *Clean Code*:  
* *Test Coverage*: *54% coverage could be better*
* *Develop strategy to reduce code smells, duplication, and technical debt ratio*
* *Select a starting Location*
* *Map with zoom and pan*

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *3-opt*: *not understanding 3 opt transformation*
* *trip destination selection*: *not prioritized*

#### What went well
* *We got together at some points and talked about what we had to do*


#### Problems encountered and resolutions
