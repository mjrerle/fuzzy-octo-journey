* Questionnaire:
1. It is generally easier to reach me by text. My phone number is 720 505 1847. I will try to
respond as quickly as possible but I do work during the week from 6pm to 10pm on
some days (depends on when my employer schedules me). I do work weekends as well
from 4pm to 10pm and again this depends on when my employer schedules me. I am
always free after 1pm to talk and work on projects. I like to work in the lab (CSB 120).
2. My expectations are that we work as soon as possible on these assignments and meet
regularly. I always aim for an A on projects and dislike turning in a project that is
incomplete or not sufficiently tested. I value communication as well. I expect my
teammates to be able to explain their thought processes and raise issue with obscured
lines of code.
3. As a team member, I would like to improve my time management skills by making a
cohesive and comprehensive plan. I would also like to improve my communication skills
by learning how each team member operates and adapt to their workstyle and generally
learn how to talk to them and delegate if needed.
4. Some obstacles I foresee are learning to adapt to other workstyles and time schedules. I
see communication as a big obstacle as well. Working together in one setting, I think, is
the best way to work on a project. If one of us is running into a logic issue or failing to
understand a particular concept I would like for us to help each other out on that issue.
5. Like I said before, I strive to achieve an A on all of our projects and I will encourage all of
my teammates to work toward the same goal.
6. It is acceptable but ideally I would like for us all to work on that A. If one team member is
working toward an A I will definitely help them out and I will encourage others to help us
out as well.
7. I expect that it will take at least 6-8 hours a week to make each project successful.
8. I think if we figure out what is expected in the project, then we can break it down into
smaller and more manageable problems that we each can specialize in. I believe that if
we are confident in an area, then we should volunteer to do exactly that.
9. If someone doesnâ€™t follow through on a task or commitment then first I would ask what
their excuse was, then figure out how to avoid this problem in the future. If it happens
again then I would request a meeting with David.
10. Differing opinions is a good time to collaborate on the quality. In this collaboration, we
can each give our input, come up with a plan of action and execute that plan so that the
final product can be something we all agree on.
11. Dealing with differing work habits is a difficult task but I think to overcome this issue we
need to communicate on the state of the project as much as possible. This means what
we have accomplished, what are doing now, and what we plan to do.
12. I would like to have a standing meeting time outside of class. If possible, the CSB 120
lab is great for this.
13. Ideally twice a week is best for us to meet outside of class. I understand that we might
have other obligations but these meetings are important for team building and
collaboration. In any case, face to face communication is the best way to tackle a
particular problem.
14. I would like approval of everyone before making a decision. That way we can avoid
future grievances or grudges.
15. If everyone agrees except one person then we should be able to make another plan for
which we all agree on.
16. I believe it is important to have a team leader but if that person is too dominating then we
should be able to have a constructive conversation about that. Elective process is
important in this aspect and downgrading a person from a delegator to a collaborator
should be a voting process.
17. I would try my best to take care of these responsibilities but if possible I would request
the help of another team member.
