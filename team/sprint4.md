# Sprint 4 - *T29* - *SPB*

## Goal

### Worldwide trips!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v4.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>4.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan 

Epics in the Sprint Backlog: 
* clean up and documentation
* Worldwide trips
* web site transition
* trip destination selection
* Optimization and selection

Total planned tasks in the Sprint Backlog: *total number of issues in sprint backlog at start*
* 

Total story points in the Sprint Backlog: *total number of story points in sprint backlog at start*
*

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | Handle change better, get together more often | Start earlier | Take advice from code climate
What we did well | Helped each other out when asked | We organized our meetings and had daily scrums | Used code climate to clean up code
What we need to work on | Collaborating, understand each other's code | Meet together more often | Listen code smells
